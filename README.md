# DATA ANALYSIS OF A MOVIE DATABASE

Data analysis process and its result as generated from The Movie Database (TMDB) for a period of 50years
In this project, I answered the data analytics questions I had posed using codes and basic visualizations.

## TOOLS USED

I made use of Jupyter Notebook and Notepad app on windpws for this project.</br>You can install Jupyter Notebook [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/).</br>Notepad app is available in windows, any other text editor would do though.
